TIP: Just replace `I` with `we` (and `am` with `are`) as a starting point for your team!

> If I do everything perfectly, what will it look like?

* I am proud of the product I am working on
* I am constantly growing and learning
* I see the impact of what I build on the business and on customers
* I enjoy working together as a team and feel that we are working toward a common goal
* I have a reputation for excellence throughout the organization and am trusted by stakeholders and peers
* I help ship code that I am proud of to production (almost) daily
* I am a valuable resource to other engineers that they feel comfortable to use (meaning that I am approachable, knowledgeable, and helpful)
