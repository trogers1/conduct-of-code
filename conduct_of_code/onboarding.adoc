= 🛳️ Onboarding

IMPORTANT: If you are onboarding, it's your job to update this list with anything you notice we forgot!

NOTE: This would be used for onboarding new engineers to the team--getting access to various softwares, email groups, slack channels, etc. But, since this is just for me, I will use it as my onboarding checklist when I get a new computer to get it set up how I like.

* [ ] Update OS

*** [ ] `brew install lazygit`
* [ ] Get `git` set up [with ssh](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) to GitHub
*** [ ] [Create new SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) and [add it](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) to the github account
* [ ] Grab My `.zprofile` from GitHub and move to `~`
* [ ] Install [NerdFonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com)
*** [ ] I’ve liked FiraCode and GoMono before…
*** [ ] Add it to your terminal(s) preferences
* [ ] Install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-and-updating)

== macOS

A unix-like environment is helpful, but you'll still need to install some things such as

* install `homebrew`
* install `nvm` with homebrew
* install docker and cogima/Rancher Desktop
* Install browsers


== Windows

I’ll need a Unix-like dev environment to develop. I am not a fan of Windows nor am I super familiar with it, so everything takes me much longer to figure out. 

To get Windows to be as much like a Unix-like system as possible, the most appropriate option is probably the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). To set up WSL, I’ll [need to install it](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-on-wsl2-on-windows-10#1-overview), which can be done via a command prompt (either `Powershell` or `cmd`). Generally, you can just use a command like

`wsl --install ubuntu`

This will install the Ubuntu subsystem.

From there, you should be able to see a "Ubuntu" startup item in your Start Menu. You can use this to launch a WSL2 terminal.

From there, you should use `git` to clone one of the team's repositories into the directory of your choosing (this will likely require you to create an SSH key).

From there, you can `cd` into the folder that was just created (you can use `ls` to view the file structure and see the folder you just created) and then use `code .` to open VS Code in WSL2. This will properly link your subsystem's file system with VS Code.

If you successfully linked WSL2, you should see this in the lower-left corner of your VS Code instance.

Linking the WSL2 file system with VS Code properly is very important! If you attempt to open the repository from within Windows itself, simple actions such as `yarn install` will take much longer to complete than normal.
