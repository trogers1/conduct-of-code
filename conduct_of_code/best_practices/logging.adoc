Manual event logging should be done for every major event (e.g. Successful Login, Request Received, Signup Failure, data request success, etc). There should be sufficient logs that you could debug a user's problem from the logs their session sent out.

Rule of thumb: if it would be useful to `console.log` or `console.info`, maybe you should log an event to the Observability software.

Logging format and what data is included should be tracked in version control for every event type. This allows us to know if any event format/data changed for any event type as well as when it changed. That way, we can adjust metrics and dashboards appropriately.
