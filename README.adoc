= 🎖️ Conduct of Code

> Note: This represents __MY__ conduct of code. The 'Conduct of Code' idea is best implemented (and was originally designed) for an entire team. To create one for a team, fork the repo and edit/rewrite each page as a team.

== What is this?

A 'Conduct of Code' is an operating manual or manifesto of best practices, goals, and guiding principles. I've generally created one with the help of my team whenever a new team is formed toward a specific goal. The documents within the 'Conduct of Code' represent the agreed-upon operating procedures and principles for the engineering team (or, in this case, my own procedures and principles).

== Purpose

The purpose of the 'Conduct of Code' is threefold:

. Codify the Mission and Values of the Group
+
While this may sounds 'mushy', having an agreed-upon set of goals and aspirations is a uniting force and allows the group to:
* Make decisions more quickly based on these shared principles
* Give meaning and purpose to the decisions they make
+
. Codify Workflows, Procedures, and Decisions
+
When decisions are made about __how__ work is completed by a group of people, it's easy for that to become tribal knowledge that shifts with each telling. Writing it down makes these sorts of decisions intentional and reference-able.
+
. Codify Best Practices
+
Stylistic things and code conventions that __cannot be caught by automations__ (e.g. 'prettier') can live here and be referenced (which can speed up code review). These sorts of things are often preferential/subjective, but a single source of truth for these conventions that can be referenced will often cut many repeated debates short.

This is a living document and a constant Work in Progress (aren't we all?). If you have suggestions on improvements, create an MR with the suggested change.
